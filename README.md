##RECIPE HASH

A hash is just another specific type of data collection, similiar to an array. With a hash, instead of using numbered indexes to access data, you use an object to do so.

A hash looks like this:
```RUBY
student_ages = {
  :victoria => 25,
  :arel => 27,
  :carley => 25, 
  :al => 26
}
```
In this example, my hash is given the variable name `student_ages`. This hash is designed to store student's ages.
